# Name: convertGrade
#
# Purpose: To convert a letter grade to its corresponding numerical value.
# This value is used to calculate the quality points that are used to
# calculate the GPA
#
# Parameters or Arguments: a string containing the letter grade, called grade
#
# Return: an integer value containing the corresponding quality points

# Function Name: calculateGPA
#
# Purpose: To get all of the semester grades the user would like to use in 
# the calculation. We will handle prompting the user for the letter grade
# and the credit hours, for as many classes as they want. We will do error
# handling to make sure it is a correct letter grade. We are going to store
# the grades and credit hours in a list of sublists.
#
# Parameters or Arguments: the semester grades, and the cumulative gpa info
# we got earlier.
#
# Return: The value returned is a list of sublists, in which each sublists 
# contains the letter grade for a given course and the associated number of
